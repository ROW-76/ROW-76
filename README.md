## Hi there👋 I'm Rowan Ignatius 👨‍💻  
- 🌱 Currently diving deep into **Hypothesis Testing and Regression**, **SPMD programming** for high-performance computing, **Data Clustring, Manipulation & Clasification**. 
- 🔭 Exploring **MATLAB GPU programming**, optimizing **Mandelbrot** partitioning, and working on parallel palindrome detection  
- 💡 Always up for conversations about efficient code, technical challenges, and speeding up complex computations  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’m turning large grids into manageable chunks and always hunting for that next speedup 🚀
